# Gas-Detection-System
A real-time embedded system built using the STM32F407 microcontroller and MQ-135 gas sensor to detect hazardous gases like LPG, methane, and carbon monoxide. The system reads analog values via the ADC, converts them to voltage, and triggers an LED alert when gas levels exceed safe thresholds. Ideal for domestic and industrial safety applications.
